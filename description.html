  <h2 class="h3 text-black">About the Home</h2>
  <p>
    The landscape design for the Limestone trails housing development highlights
    the natural beauty of the Texas Hill Country with native wildflowers,
    heritage oaks, and sustainable xeriscaping. Limestone paths wind through
    drought-tolerant gardens, leading to shaded picnic areas, fire pits, and
    splash pads. Rain gardens and dry creek beds enhance stormwater management,
    while scenic lookouts and gazebos provide stunning Hill Country views,
    creating a harmonious, eco-friendly community space.
